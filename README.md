   If needed, install Python using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install python@3.12
   ```

2. **Project Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create and enter project directory
   mkdir my_crewai_project
   cd my_crewai_project

   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install CrewAI**
   ```bash
   pip install 'crewai[tools]'
   ```

4. **Create Project**
   ```bash
   crewai create crew <project_name>
   ```

5. **Run Project**
   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

### Windows Installation

1. **Check Python Version**
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   If needed, download Python 3.12 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   > ⚠️ Important: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Install Microsoft Buildtools**

   Microsoft Buildtools is required for certain packages in CrewAI to run.
   Follow this [guide](https://github.com/bycloudai/InstallVSBuildToolsWindows?tab=readme-ov-file) to install.

3. **Project Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create and enter project directory
   mkdir my_crewai_project
   cd my_crewai_project

   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install CrewAI**
   ```bash
   pip install 'crewai[tools]'

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

### READY TO ROCK!

Try setting up your first crew with Crewai's quickstart [guide](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart)

HIGHLY recommended to do the two Deeplearning.ai courses mentioned earlier in this guide!
Now have some fun!

## Tips for Success
1. Always use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts
2. Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
3. Check the [official documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/installation) for troubleshooting and updates
